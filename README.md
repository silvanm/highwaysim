# SIMPLE HIGHWAY SIMULATOR #

This little toy is a simple simulator of cars on a highway. Play with the parameters or stop a car by touching it. As a game try to maximize the throughput. It will show you why traffic will become much more performant once everyone drives self-driving cars.
            
What's the point?
There are many reasons that I build this app: I want to show my kids (and myself) how traffic jams happen. It's an interesting challenge. And besides playing with my kids, run, bike and swim that's what I _love_ doing during my vacations in Spain.
